#### Part 1
1. What is the rank of this matrix?    
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 3 & -5 \\ 2 & 1 & 5 & -9 \\ 6 & -1 & -2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$   
rank = 3
   
2. What is the reduced row-echelon form of the above matrix?   
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & \frac { 2 }{ 55 }  \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \frac { -14 }{ 55 }  \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \frac { -97 }{ 55 }  \end{bmatrix}$   
   
3. Define orthonormal basis vectors. Please write down at least one orthonormal basis for the 4-dimensional vector space $R^4$.   
Orthonormal basic vectors must be:   
"... all unit vectors and orthogonal to each other." [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthonormal_basis)   
One such vectorset is: 
$R^4=[v1=(1,0,0,0),v2=(0,1,0,0),v3=(0,0,1,0), v4=(0,0,0,1)]$   
   
4. Given the following matrix, what is its characteristic polynomial?   
$\begin{bmatrix} 6 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 7 & -1 \\ -1 & 3 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$   
$x^3−13x^2+46x−25$   
   
5. What are its eigenvectors and eigenvalues? Please note that it is possible to get complex vectors as eigenvectors.
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(6,1,1,0,7,-1,-1,3,0),3,3,byrow=T)
(A <- eigen(A))
```
6. Given a column stochastic matrix of links between URLs, what can you say about the PageRank of this set of URLs? How is it related to its eigendecomposition?   
    
7. Assuming that we are repeatedly sampling sets of numbers (each set is of size n) from an unknown probability density function. What can we say about the mean value of each set?   
    
8. What is the derivative of $e^x sin^2(x)$?   
${e}^{x}sin(x)(sin(x)+2cos(x))$
   
9. What is the derivative of $log(x^3 + sin(x))$?   
Use the chain rule   
$\frac{\cos\left(x\right)+3}{\ln{\left(10\right)}\left(3x+\sin\left(x\right)\right)}$
   
10. What is $\int{e^x cos(x) + sin(x)dx}$? Don’t forget the constant of integration.     
$\frac {{e}^{x}(sin(x)+cos(x))}{2} −cos(x)+C$
